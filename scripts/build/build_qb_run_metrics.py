# Outputs two CSVs (weekly, 2025 season by default):
#   A) qb_scramble_rates.csv  -> player,week,scramble_rate,scrambles,dropbacks
#   B) qb_designed_runs.csv   -> player,week,designed_run_rate,designed_runs,snaps
#
# Data source (free):
# - nflverse/nflfastR play-by-play (contains qb_scramble, qb_dropback, qb_kneel, play_type, rush_attempt, passer_player_name, rusher_player_name, week)
#   Docs: https://nflfastr.com/reference/fast_scraper.html  (variable: qb_scramble)
#         https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/ (data access & dictionaries)
#         https://brieger.esalq.usp.br/CRAN/web/packages/nflreadr/vignettes/dictionary_pbp.html  (qb_dropback, qb_kneel)
#
# Implementation notes:
# - We fetch the public season CSV from nflverse releases (pbp_2025.csv.gz). If that URL fails, try a small set of fallbacks.
# - QB identification for rush plays uses a pragmatic rule:
#     * Build a set of names that appear as a passer in 2025 (season-to-date).
#     * A rusher is treated as a QB if their name appears in that passer set.
# - "Snaps" proxy = dropbacks + all QB rush attempts (scrambles + designed). This aligns with QB involvement on offensive plays.
# - Designed runs exclude scrambles and kneels: rush_attempt==1 & qb_scramble!=1 & qb_kneel!=1 & rusher is QB.
