# The latest `nflreadpy` wheel on PyPI is 0.1.3 (Python ≤3.11).  To avoid the
# resolver conflict you saw when different packages demanded overlapping—but
# incompatible—ranges, we now keep only the minimum versions required for the
# 2025 endpoints and let pip decide everything else.  That means Actions can
# downgrade to a compatible pair automatically when a newer release introduces
# tighter bounds than the wheels currently published to PyPI.
