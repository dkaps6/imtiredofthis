# The latest `nflreadpy` wheel on PyPI is 0.1.3 (Python ≤3.11).  To avoid the
# conflicting resolver requests you observed (simultaneous <0.3 and ≥0.3
# constraints), we keep the lower bounds required for 2025 data but otherwise
# allow pip to choose any compatible wheel available in your environment.  That
# way new releases can be picked up automatically once they land on PyPI.
