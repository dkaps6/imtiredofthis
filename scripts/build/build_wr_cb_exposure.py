# Free weekly WR–CB exposure/matchups builder for the 2025 season.

# NOTES & ASSUMPTIONS
# - Team canonicalization: opponent is the defensive team code (ARI, ATL, ..., WAS).
# - We auto-detect the *current* NFL week window from PFR. Run daily/weekly to get an updated file.
# - slot_pct / wide_pct:
#     tries headless render (requests_html) of RotoWire; if not available, uses season-level table as a proxy,
#     or leaves blank with a warning.
# - exp_vs_man / exp_vs_zone are filled from Sharp’s *opponent* Man/Zone rates (transparent proxy).
# - expected_primary_cb / vs_shadow_flag are parsed heuristically from RotoBaller’s current week article.
#   If parsing fails, fields remain blank; you still get opponent + coverage exposure from schedule+Sharp.
